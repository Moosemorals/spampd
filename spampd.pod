=head1 Description

I<spampd> is an SMTP/LMTP proxy that marks (or tags) spam using
SpamAssassin (L<http://www.SpamAssassin.org/>). The proxy is designed
to be transparent to the sending and receiving mail servers and at no point
takes responsibility for the message itself. If a failure occurs within
I<spampd> (or SpamAssassin) then the mail servers will disconnect and the
sending server is still responsible for retrying the message for as long
as it is configured to do so.

I<spampd> uses SpamAssassin to modify (tag) relayed messages based on 
their spam score, so all SA settings apply. This is described in the SA 
documentation.  I<spampd> will by default only tell SA to tag a 
message if it exceeds the spam threshold score, however you can have 
it rewrite all messages passing through by adding the --tagall option 
(see SA for how non-spam messages are tagged).

I<spampd> logs all aspects of its operation to syslog(8), using the
mail syslog facility.

The latest version can be found at L<https://github.com/mpaperno/spampd>.

=head1 Operation

I<spampd> is meant to operate as an S/LMTP mail proxy which passes
each message through SpamAssassin for analysis.  Note that I<spampd>
does not do anything other than check for spam, so it is not suitable as
an anti-relay system.  It is meant to work in conjunction with your
regular mail system.  Typically one would pipe any messages they wanted
scanned through I<spampd> after initial acceptance by your MX host.
This is especially useful for using Postfix's (http://www.postfix.org) 
advanced content filtering mechanism, although certainly not limited to 
that application.

Please re-read the second sentence in the above paragraph.  You should NOT
enable I<spampd> to listen on a public interface (IP address) unless you
know exactly what you're doing!  It is very easy to set up an open relay this
way.

Here are some simple examples (square brackets in the "diagrams" indicate
physical machines):


B<Running between firewall/gateway and internal mail server>

=over 3

The firewall/gateway MTA would be configured to forward all of its mail 
to the port that I<spampd> listens on, and I<spampd> would relay its 
messages to port 25 of your internal server. I<spampd> could either 
run on its own host (and listen on any port) or it could run on either 
mail server (and listen on any port except port 25).

 Internet -> [ MX gateway (@inter.net.host:25) -> 
	spampd (@localhost:2025) ] ->
	Internal mail (@private.host.ip:25)

=back

B<Using Postfix advanced content filtering>

=over 3

Please see the F<FILTER_README> that came with the Postfix distribution.  You
need to have a version of Postfix which supports this (ideally v.2 and up).

 Internet -> [ Postfix (@inter.net.host:25) -> 
	spampd (@localhost:10025) -> 
	Postfix (@localhost:10026) ] -> final delivery

=back

Note that these examples only show incoming mail delivery.  Since it is 
often unnecessary to scan mail coming from your network, it may be desirable 
to set up a separate outbound route which bypasses I<spampd>.

=head1 Installation / Configuration

I<spampd> can be run directly from the command prompt if desired.  This is
useful for testing purposes, but for long term use you probably want to put
it somewhere like /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin and execute it at system startup.
For example on Red Hat-style Linux system one can use a script in 
/etc/rc.d/init.d to start I<spampd> (a L<sample script|https://github.com/mpaperno/spampd/tree/master/misc> 
is available in the I<spampd> code repository).

I<spampd> is available as a B<package> for a significant number of Linux distributions,
including Debian and derivatives (Ubuntu, etc). This is typically the easiest/best way
to install and configure I<spampd> since it should already take into account any system 
specifics for setting up and running as a daemon, etc.  Note however that packages 
might not offer the latest version of I<spampd>. A good reference for available
packages and their versions can be found at L<https://repology.org/project/spampd/versions>.

I<spampd> is also used in the turnkey L<Mail-in-a-Box|https://mailinabox.email/>
project, which includes Postfix as the main MTA and Dovecot as the local delivery agent 
with LMTP protocol. Even if you don't need the turnkey solution, it may be imformative 
to peruse the MIAB L<setup|https://github.com/mail-in-a-box/mailinabox/tree/master/setup> /
L<configuration|https://github.com/mail-in-a-box/mailinabox/tree/master/conf> files for reference.

All I<spampd> options have reasonable defaults, especially for a Postfix-centric
installation.  You may want to specify the --children option if you have an
especially beefy or weak server box because I<spampd> is a memory-hungry 
program.  Check the L<"Options"> for details on this and all other parameters.

Note that B<I<spampd> replaces I<spamd>> from the I<SpamAssassin> distribution
in function. You do not need to run I<spamd> in order for I<spampd> to work.
This has apparently been the source of some confusion, so now you know.

=head2 Postfix-specific Notes

Here is a typical setup for Postfix "advanced" content filtering as described
in the F<FILTER_README> that came with the Postfix distribution (which you 
really need to read):

F</etc/postfix/master.cf>:
 
 smtp	inet	n	-	y	-	-	smtpd
 	-o content_filter=smtp:localhost:10025
	-o myhostname=mx.example.com

 localhost:10026	inet	n	-	n	-	10	smtpd
 	-o content_filter=
 	-o myhostname=mx-int.example.com

The first entry is the main public-facing MTA which uses localhost:10025
as the content filter for all mail.	The second entry receives mail from
the content filter and does final delivery.  Both smtpd instances use
the same Postfix F<main.cf> file.  I<spampd> is the process that listens on
localhost:10025 and then connects to the Postfix listener on localhost:10026.
Note that the C<myhostname> options must be different between the two instances,
otherwise Postfix will think it's talking to itself and abort sending.

For the above example you can simply start I<spampd> like this:

 spampd --host=localhost:10025 --relayhost=localhost:10026

F<FILTER_README> from the Postfix distro has more details and examples of
various setups, including how to skip the content filter for outbound mail.

Another tip for Postfix when considering what timeout values to use for
--childtimout and --satimeout options is the following command:

C<# postconf | grep timeout>

This will return a list of useful timeout settings and their values.  For 
explanations see the relevant C<man> page (smtp, smtpd, lmtp).  By default
I<spampd> is set up for the default Postfix timeout values.

The following guide has some more specific setup instructions:
B<L<Integrating SpamAssassin into Postfix using spampd|https://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin/IntegratePostfixViaSpampd>>

=head1 Upgrading

If upgrading from a version prior to 2.2, please note that the --add-sc-header
option is no longer supported.  Use SA's built-in header manipulation features
instead (as of SA v2.6).

Upgrading from version 1 simply involves replacing the F<spampd> program file
with the latest one.  Note that the I<dead-letters> folder is no longer being
used and the --dead-letters option is no longer needed (though no errors are
thrown if it's present).  Check the L<"Options"> list below for a full list of new
and deprecated options.  Also be sure to check out the change log.

=head1 Options

=over 5

=item B<--host=(ip|hostname)[:port]>

Specifies what hostname/IP and port I<spampd> listens on. By default, it listens
on 127.0.0.1 (localhost) on port 10025. 

B<Important!> You should NOT enable I<spampd> to listen on a
public interface (IP address) unless you know exactly what you're doing!

=item B<--port=n>

Specifies what port I<spampd> listens on. By default, it listens on
port 10025. This is an alternate to using the above --host=ip:port notation.

=item B<--socket=socketpath>

Specifies what UNIX socket I<spampd> listens on. If this is specified,
--host and --port are ignored.

=item B<--socket-perms=mode>

The file mode fo the created UNIX socket (see --socket) in octal
format, e.g. 700 to specify acces only for the user spampd is run as.

=item B<--relayhost=(ip|hostname)[:port]>

Specifies the hostname/IP to which I<spampd> will relay all
messages. Defaults to 127.0.0.1 (localhost). If the port is not provided, that
defaults to 25.

=item B<--relayport=n>

Specifies what port I<spampd> will relay to. Default is 25. This is an 
alternate to using the above --relayhost=ip:port notation.

=item B<--relaysocket=socketpath>

Specifies what UNIX socket spampd will relay to. If this is specified
--relayhost and --relayport will be ignored.

=item B<--user=username> or B<-u=username>

=item B<--group=groupname> or  B<-g=groupname>

Specifies the user and/or group that the proxy will run as. Default is
I<mail>/I<mail>.

=item B<--children=n> or B<-c=n>

Number of child servers to start and maintain (where n > 0). Each child will 
process up to --maxrequests (below) before exiting and being replaced by 
another child.  Keep this number low on systems w/out a lot of memory. 
Default is 5 (which seems OK on a 512MB lightly loaded system).  Note that 
there is always a parent process running, so if you specify 5 children you
will actually have 6 I<spampd> processes running.

You may want to set your origination mail server to limit the 
number of concurrent connections to I<spampd> to match this setting (for 
Postfix this is the C<xxxx_destination_concurrency_limit> setting where 
'xxxx' is the transport being used, usually 'smtp', and the default is 100).

=item B<--maxrequests=n>

I<spampd> works by forking child servers to handle each message. The
B<maxrequests> parameter specifies how many requests will be handled
before the child exits. Since a child never gives back memory, a large
message can cause it to become quite bloated; the only way to reclaim
the memory is for the child to exit. The default is 20.

=item B<--childtimeout=n>

This is the number of seconds to allow each child server before it times out
a transaction. In an S/LMTP transaction the timer is reset for every command. 
This timeout includes time it would take to send the message data, so it should 
not be too short.  Note that it's more likely the origination or destination
mail servers will timeout first, which is fine.  This is just a "sane" failsafe.
Default is 360 seconds (6 minutes).

=item B<--satimeout=n>

This is the number of seconds to allow for processing a message with
SpamAssassin (including feeding it the message, analyzing it, and adding 
the headers/report if necessary).  
This should be less than your origination and destination servers' timeout 
settings for the DATA command. For Postfix the default is 300 seconds in both
cases (smtp_data_done_timeout and smtpd_timeout). In the event of timeout
while processing the message, the problem is logged and the message is passed
on anyway (w/out spam tagging, obviously).  To fail the message with a temp
450 error, see the --dose (die-on-sa-errors) option, below.
Default is 285 seconds.

=item B<--pid=filename> or B<-p=filename>

Specifies a filename where I<spampd> will write its process ID so
that it is easy to kill it later. The directory that will contain this
file must be writable by the I<spampd> user. The default is
F</var/run/spampd.pid>.

=item B<--logsock=(unix|inet)> C<(new in v2.20)>

Syslog socket to use.  May be either "unix" of "inet".  Default is "unix"
except on HP-UX and SunOS (Solaris) systems which seem to prefer "inet".

=item B<--nodetach> C<(new in v2.20)>

If this option is given spampd won't detach from the console and fork into the
background. This can be useful for running under control of some daemon
management tools or when configured as a win32 service under cygrunsrv's
control.

=item B<--setsid> C<(new in v2.51)>

If this option is given spampd will fork after the bind method to release
itself from the command line and then run the POSIX::setsid() command to truly
daemonize. Only used if --nodetach isn't specified.

=item B<--maxsize=n>

The maximum message size to send to SpamAssassin, in KBytes. By default messages
over 64KB are not scanned at all, and an appropriate message is logged
indicating this.  The size includes headers and attachments (if any).

=item B<--dose>

Acronym for (d)ie (o)n (s)pamAssassin (e)rrors.  By default if I<spampd>
encounters a problem with processing the message through Spam Assassin (timeout 
or other error), it will still pass the mail on to the destination server.  If 
you specify this option however, the mail is instead rejected with a temporary 
error (code 450, which means the origination server should keep retrying to send 
it).  See the related --satimeout option, above.

=item B<--tagall> or B<-a>

Tells I<spampd> to have SpamAssassin add headers to all scanned mail,
not just spam.  By default I<spampd> will only rewrite messages which 
exceed the spam threshold score (as defined in the SA settings).  Note that
for this option to work as of SA-2.50, the I<always_add_report> and/or 
I<always_add_headers> settings in your SpamAssassin F<local.cf> need to be 
set to 1/true.

=item B<--log-rules-hit> or B<--rh>

Logs the names of each SpamAssassin rule which matched the message being 
processed.  This list is returned by SA.

=item B<--set-envelope-headers> or B<--seh> C<(new in v2.30)>

Turns on addition of X-Envelope-To and X-Envelope-From headers to the mail
being scanned before it is passed to SpamAssassin. The idea is to help SA 
process any blacklist/whitelist to/from directives on the actual 
sender/recipients instead of the possibly bogus envelope headers. This 
potentially exposes the list of all recipients of that mail (even BCC'd ones). 
Therefore usage of this option is discouraged. 

I<NOTE>: Even though I<spampd> tries to prevent this leakage by removing the
X-Envelope-To header after scanning, SpamAssassin itself might add headers
that report recipient(s) listed in X-Envelope-To.

=item B<--set-envelope-from> or B<--sef> C<(new in v2.30)>

Same as above option but only enables the addition of X-Envelope-From header.
For those that don't feel comfortable with the possible information exposure
of X-Envelope-To.  The above option overrides this one.

=item B<--auto-whitelist> or B<--aw> C<(deprecated with SpamAssassin v3+)>

This option is no longer relevant with SA version 3.0 and above, which
controls auto whitelist use via config file settings. This option is likely to
be removed in the future.  Do not use it unless you must use an older SA
version.

For SA version < 3.0, turns on the SpamAssassin global whitelist feature.  
See the SA docs. Note that per-user whitelists are not available.

B<NOTE>: B<DBBasedAddrList> is used as the storage mechanism. If you wish to use
a different mechanism (such as SQLBasedAddrList), the I<spampd> code will 
need to be modified in 2 instances (search the source for DBBasedAddrList).

=item B<--local-only> or B<-L>

Turn off all SA network-based tests (DNS, Razor, etc).

=item B<--homedir=directory>

Use the specified directory as home directory for the spamassassin process. 
Things like the auto-whitelist and other plugin (razor/pyzor) files get
written to here.
Default is /var/spool/spamassassin/spampd.  A good place for this is in the same
place your bayes_path SA config setting points to (if any).  Make sure this
directory is accessible to the user that spampd is running as (default: mail).
New in v2.40. Thanks to Alexander Wirt for this fix.

=item B<--saconfig=filename>

Use the specified file for SpamAssassin configuration options in addition to the
default local.cf file.  Any options specified here will override the same
option from local.cf.  Default is to not use any additional configuration file.

=item B<--debug> or B<-d>

Turns on SpamAssassin debug messages which print to the system mail log
(same log as spampd will log to).  Also turns on more verbose logging of 
what spampd is doing (new in v2).  Also increases log level of Net::Server
to 4 (debug), adding yet more info (but not too much) (new in v2.2).

=item B<--version>

Prints version information about SpamPD, Net::Server, SpamAssassin, and Perl.

=item B<--help> or B<-h> or B<-?>

Prints usage information.

Sending TTIN signal to the master process will dynamically increase
the number of children by one, and TTOU signal will decrease it by one.

=item Running between firewall/gateway and internal mail server:

I<spampd> listens on port 10025 on the same host as the internal mail server.

  spampd --host=192.168.1.10

Same as above but I<spampd> runs on port 10025 of the same host as 
the firewall/gateway and passes messages on to the internal mail server 
on another host.

  spampd --relayhost=192.168.1.10

=item Using Postfix advanced content filtering example
and disable SA network checks:

  spampd --port=10025 --relayhost=127.0.0.1:10026 --local-only

=item Using UNIX sockets instead if INET ports:

Spampd listens on the UNIX socket /var/run/spampd.socket with
persmissions 700 instead of a TCP port:

  spampd --socket /var/run/spampd.socket --socket-perms 700

Spampd will relay mail to /var/run/dovecot/lmtp instead of a TCP port:

  spampd --relaysocket /var/run/dovecot/lmtp

Remember that the user spampd runs as needs to have read AND write
permissions on the relaysocket!

=head1 To Do

Figure out how to use Net::Server::PreFork because it has cool potential for
load management.  I tried but either I'm missing something or PreFork is
somewhat broken in how it works.  If anyone has experience here, please let 
me know.

Add configurable option for rejecting mail outright based on spam score.
It would be nice to make this program safe enough to sit in front of a mail 
server such as Postfix and be able to reject mail before it enters our systems.
The only real problem is that Postfix will see localhost as the connecting
client, so that disables any client-based checks Postfix can do and creates a 
possible relay hole if localhost is trusted.
